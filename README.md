A simple shmup game to get my grandson coding.

The game uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) set of [Python](https://www.python.org/) modules and follows tutorials from [KidsCanCode](www.kidscancode.org) and the videos on their YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGufy7weyGY).  A **Big Thanks** to **KidsCanCode**.
